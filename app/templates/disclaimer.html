          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Demo Application Status</h5>
          <p>CloudSpend is a portfolio demonstration project showcasing frontend and backend development skills. It is not a real financial service and does not actually connect to financial institutions or process real financial data. All data shown is fictional and for demonstration purposes only.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Understanding CloudSpend's Role</h5>
          <p>If CloudSpend were a real application, it would be a tool for organizing financial information, not a source of financial advice. In a real-world scenario, users would need to verify any important financial decisions with qualified professionals.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Information Accuracy</h5>
          <p>The sample data displayed in CloudSpend is fictional and created solely for demonstration purposes. In a real application, no representations or warranties would be made about the completeness, reliability, or accuracy of any information provided.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Not Financial Advice</h5>
          <p>The content provided through CloudSpend is for demonstration and educational purposes only and is not intended to be financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. This application should not be used for actual financial planning or decision-making.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Calculations and Projections</h5>
          <p>Any calculations, projections, or insights shown in CloudSpend are based on fictional data and simplified algorithms created for demonstration purposes. They do not reflect real-world financial modeling or analysis.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Zakat Calculations</h5>
          <p>The Zakat calculation feature is a demonstration of technical implementation only. In a real application, such calculations would be based on general principles and users would be advised to consult with a qualified Islamic scholar for definitive guidance.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Third-Party Services</h5>
          <p>While CloudSpend's interface may suggest integration with third-party services such as banking APIs, no actual connections are made. In a production environment, users would be informed about third-party service terms and privacy policies.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Azure Deployment</h5>
          <p>CloudSpend is designed to demonstrate Azure cloud deployment capabilities. The application architecture showcases how a real financial application could be deployed using Azure services, but does not necessarily utilize all mentioned services in the demonstration version.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Mobile Optimization</h5>
          <p>CloudSpend features responsive design optimized for mobile devices. This demonstrates mobile-first development practices but does not constitute a full mobile application.</p>
          
          <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">Limitation of Liability</h5>
          <p>As a portfolio demonstration project, CloudSpend and its developers assume no liability for any use or misuse of this application or its code. The application is provided strictly for demonstration and educational purposes.</p>

app.py - Main Flask Application for Muzzy Tracker

This file serves as the entry point for the Muzzy Tracker finance web application.
It initializes the Flask application, defines routes, and handles HTTP requests.
The application allows users to track finances, analyze spending patterns, and calculate Zakat.

Routes:
    / - Landing page with hero section, about section, and login form
    /login - Handles login form submission (POST)
    /register - Placeholder for user registration

Future integrations:
    - Plaid API for bank account connections
    - Azure Database for MySQL for data storage
    - Azure Blob Storage for file uploads
